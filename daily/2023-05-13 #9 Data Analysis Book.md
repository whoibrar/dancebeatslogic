Yet another day, No wifi. 

I am not exactly sure where and what’s the issue but this did significantly limit my progress. Luckily, I had got myself a physical copy of this book *[“Data Analysis with Open Source Tools](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-analysis-with/9781449389802/)”* from the library. Yes, libraries do exist, and physical books are nice too.

I just read the introduction chapter and so far it has been good. Will be taking notes and update this when I finish it.
