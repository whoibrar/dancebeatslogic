I spent the later evening catching up with friends over dinner. I told them about this project. The commitment to learn something new. Everyday Making some progress towards the end goal of getting a remote job in Data Science. 

I made a bet that for each day I miss, I’ll pay Rs1000. The bet shall last until the end of this year or I change my career trajectory completely, which ever comes first. 

It was initially 500 and they were so confident of making free money, similarly I felt strong about my commitment. Hence doubled it. If I never miss a day It doesn’t actually matter how much the price is said, right ?

I am not sure how this bet will turn not. I might never miss a day or look back and cringe at it. Also I’ll probably spend some time building some sort of timer/stopwatch, that should show time elapsed between two blog posts.

Learned about Numpy’s inbuilt methods to compare arrays.

It can be done using 

- `logical_and()`
- `logical_or()`
- `logical_not()`

```python
ages = [8,13,33,26,25,16,14,12]
teens = ages>12 and ages<20 
# ValueError : The truth value of an aray with more than 
# one element is ambigous

teens = np.logical_and(ages>12,ages<20)
print(ages) # array([13,16,14])
```
