I came across this two part [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUJ170KJIfM) by Bill Howe, University of Washington, on Introduction to data science. It gives more academic outlook and so far the style of teaching is pretty good. It is total of 14hrs of content and I’ve watched just about an hour of it.

I started a short spreadsheets course on datacamp. This time instructor is James. I thought I’ll be able to finish it soon, but I lost wifi and didn’t make much progress with it .
