As soon as I woke up went out to meet a bunch of friends and came back very late, being too exhausted. I just laid down and almost fell asleep. *************************Oh shit, no progress today.************************* 

On one hand, I wouldn’t want to give-up on day 3 itself. And on other, I didn’t even had energy to get up and turn the light off let alone go trough the whole process of reading, understanding, solving and taking notes. Somehow or the other, I pushed myself and made this a non zero day.

Non Zero Days is a concept that originated from a [reddit comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/deleted_by_user/cdah4af/) that talks about pushing yourself on the tough days to take even the smallest possible action, resulting in you making some progress. Therefore turning the zero day to a non-zero day. 

> What is a (Non) Zero day ? 
 “*A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on.”*

> What do you do ?
> *Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero.*

## Learnings

Comparison operations work on strings. So, we can do use it to settle the age old question of 

```python
"vim">"emacs" # True
```

The comparison operator on strings works by comparing the two strings lexicographically, i.e., comparing ascii/unicode value of each character.

 How does numpy perform number and array comparison operations under the hood ? By creating an array of same size from the given number and performing one to one comparisons.

```python
vals = [1,2,3,4,5]
greater_vals = vals>3 
print(greater_vals) #[False, False, False, True, True
```
